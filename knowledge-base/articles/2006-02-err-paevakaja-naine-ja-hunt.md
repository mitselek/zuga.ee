### Concept

Two generations, two cameras. Bush and Kaja spent a week in the middle of Estonian forest at Jõepere farm. How do they bring this experience to the stage?

Woman speaks Estonian, Wolf speaks English.

Woman looks down, further down, puts hand on floor, pulls leg after and slowly starts rising, moving in a spiral...

Wolf moves with quick steps, head hanging, hands dangling at sides. Stops, lifts chin up, listens, shakes herself all over...

- Different from ZUGA's later focus on children's performances

## Potential Uses

- **Performance archive** - If "Naine ja hunt" page is created, this provides premiere documentation
- **ZUGA history** - Early work timeline (pre-children's theatre focus)
- **Press coverage archive** - Media attention in 2006
- **Research** - Understanding ZUGA's artistic development and repertoire diversity

## Notes

This performance is not currently documented in the website's content pages. It represents ZUGA's work before their shift to focus primarily on children's contemporary dance theatre.
