## Dance Performance for Children "The Passage"

**Recommended age:** 6–10 years

*On that lost Thursday night,
when the sun had bewitched itself into the moon,
we became sailors
and the maple turned into a mast.
There in the distance
shone an island with a cave of secrets,
where we had wanted to go
once or twice…
Four of us and a game and a story,
which will win, we don't even know,
whether adventure
or the pure joy of play.*

"The Passage" is a dance performance where friendships and trust are put to the test. Playing together becomes essential. Playing with each other and playing with movement and sound. The joy of play is shared in the performance between the performers as well as between the audience and performers, so that at one moment the audience discovers themselves as part of the performance.

Eva-Liisa Linder writes: "This kind of collaborative theatre reminds us that theatre was born from ritual. This is an inventive and dance-based participatory theatre, where children's reactions form a large part of the performance's charm and where there is no fear of playing 'through the audience' – on the contrary, this is calculated into the performance's structure…

Zuga is one of the few troupes creating contemporary dance theatre for young children. But hopefully it is encouraging that already in their first decade they have managed to make a very good name in this theatrical genre." *(Zuga children's theatre: watching is silver, participating is gold / January Dance Info newsletter)*
