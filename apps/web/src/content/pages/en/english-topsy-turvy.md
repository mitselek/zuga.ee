# Topsy-Turvy

The idea began with the question of why we don't always understand each other, and of course with our play objects – balls. Balls are created for playing together, although sometimes the question arises in our performance whether we are playing with the ball or the ball is playing with us.

On stage, in an environment created by artist Illimar Vihmar and lighting designer Targo Miilimaa, there are numerous balls made from different materials, and the performance was built through conversation, debate, and playing with balls and creating shapes.

The performance tells about negotiation and consideration for each other. According to dramaturg Piret Jaaks, one shouldn't be afraid to offer children so-called abstract movement, visual, and sound moments, for which Lauri-Dag Tüür's sound design has created a sensitive world. "A child's imagination is so open, they go along with the play or create their own game or thought in between," said Jaaks.

According to the artistic director of the Estonian Youth Theatre, Mirko Rajas, "this is truly a very unique event where two very different collectives aimed at young audiences have found common ground and come together in the rehearsal hall."

"Topsy-Turvy" is a family performance that weaves together both physical and visual theatre.
