# Weather or Not

What does the weather do to us or we to the weather, what do we hear and see about the weather? What will tomorrow’s weather bring? Will we be left without our weather?

**Premiere:** October 26, 2024, Sõltumatu Tantsu Lava
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Recommended age:** 10 years and up

Zuga United Dancers' playful dance performance deals with weather and environmental themes: the WORLD, WEATHER forecast, BEING WITHOUT. Together with the audience, we explore ways in which weather and climate change affect us in our own bodies and on our own skin. Can we reach a solution together?

Performances are followed by a small discussion with the creators and audience to further explore the themes addressed in the production.

## Zuga United Dancers

Zuga United Dancers is an association of dancers and choreographers that has been working together since 1999. They are the only group in Estonia that consistently and regularly creates dance performances for children. For Zuga, children and adults are equal partners who share the same world and living space.

Their children's performances have received attention and numerous theatre and dance awards (Salme Reek Award, Draamake Award, Estonian Theatre Annual Award, Independent Performing Arts Award), and they have performed with their productions both in Estonia and abroad (Finland, USA, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Netherlands, Palestine, Sweden, Russia, Romania, Croatia, Poland, England, China).

## Audience Feedback

*“The performance made me think about how we sometimes don't even notice how we affect our surroundings. It actually seems quite unnatural that people have so quickly developed technology and machines and started mass-producing so many things.”* – Student who attended the performance

*“The dancers' movement language was sometimes unpredictable, which made the whole story even more interesting. I would recommend this performance to everyone, because everyone will get some new thought for themselves.”* – Student who attended the performance
