## Future Movers

**Kumu and Independent Dance Stage collaboration educational visit**

Kumu and Independent Dance Stage invited senior kindergarten children and grades 1-6 students to the exhibition "[Jeremy Shaw. Phase Shifting Index](https://kunstimuuseum.ekm.ee/syndmus/jeremy-shaw-phase-shifting-index/)". The educational visit created in collaboration between Kumu and Zuga United Dancers consisted of a physically engaging exhibition experience and a creative movement workshop.

### The Educational Visit

Participants traveled with Kumu's education curator into the distant future in the exhibition to meet 22nd century people. There they became researchers who observed and reflected on the body language communication of future humans. They noticed their similarities and differences – in appearance, movement, and emotions. Playfully discovering the space in which the artwork is located and the spaces within the artwork. After visiting the exhibition, discussion followed about what the worldview of these people might be and what story or feeling they might convey to us through dance.

Since dance movement and physical experience were recurring elements in the exhibition, movements were captured from the work and taken to continue working with them in the workshop, led by members of ZUGA United Dancers. There, the body was also used as a tool, exploring movement with sounds, expressing emotions with the body, and conveying messages.

Through imagination, many creative movement exercises were tried out – both individually and in group work, thereby developing physical awareness, inner concentration, and consideration for others.

### About the Exhibition

The educational visit took place in connection with one of today's most interesting and exciting artists, Jeremy Shaw's giant video, sound, light and spatial installation "Phase Shifting Index", which offered a powerful vision of humanity's future. The climax of the work featured flashing light play and loud, intense music.

The museum lesson-workshop integrates themes from art, human studies, and movement education.
