# Magic Stuff

_"We want to find the magic that is hidden in the essence of small everyday things, for example, a simple movement, a sound, a whisper, a moment of something happening, and create an opening to look at things we usually don't notice."_
— Tiina Mölder, choreographer

**Premiere:** October 8, 2011, Kanuti Gildi SAAL
**Duration:** 40 minutes
**Age recommendation:** 4-7 years

Zuga has created a new dance piece for children about a wonder world, magic and game. In children's games, most things happen with a little help of magic. The idea is to visit a far-away land without leaving the room.

Together with children, we embark on a fantasy-filled journey and open many secret doors to discover new and exciting things - all without stepping out through a real door.

### Guest Performance at Rakvere Theatre

Magic Stuff reached Rakvere audiences in December 2011 as part of Rakvere Theatre's "RT ESITLEB" (RT PRESENTS) series. The performance was shown twice – at 11:00 AM and 6:00 PM – to accommodate all magic enthusiasts, both young and old.

RT ESITLEB is a Rakvere Theatre project that brings performances from small theatres, independent theatre troupes, and similar groups to Rakvere audiences once a month. Magic Stuff was a perfect fit for the series as an unconventional children's performance in contemporary theatre style, combining dance, play, and audience interaction.
