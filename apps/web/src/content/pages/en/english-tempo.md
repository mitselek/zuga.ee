## Dance Performance "Tempo"

"Tempo" is a dance performance that synthesizes movement, music and video. The theme of the performance is time: tempos, rhythms, flow, growth, acceleration, arrival, being. Tempo within us and around us, in nature and in the city, a person in the midst of their daily activities, in special moments, moving along with time, falling behind, searching for their own tempo, others' tempo, losing it and finding it again.

Time is always the same and always so different. Sometimes it's fast, sometimes there's plenty of time. Sometimes it's exciting, sometimes terribly boring. Sometimes the rush is justified and meaningful, sometimes it's just running on sand. Sometimes you want to keep up, sometimes shake others off, other times fall behind yourself and amble calmly at your own tempo, with your own music, your own perception, your own view of the world and what surrounds you.

Which are the moments that could last longer? Which are the moments that stay in memory? Life circles and spinning wheels. The creators of "Tempo" are interested in the different rhythms of city and nature, as well as rhythms that are meeting and melting points of different environments.
