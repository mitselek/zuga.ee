In mindStuff workshop, different feelings are played and danced through. Self expressing is carried out through movement and sensing each other both in pairs and in a group. The lesson consists of movement games and physical expression of one's state of mind and feelings. The lesson ends with a feelings-based movement routine created collectively that is succeeded by a discussion.

This workshop is a suitable extra for regular school lessons where feelings and emotions are studied.
