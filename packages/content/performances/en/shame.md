I pull my head between my shoulders and shrink to my own shadow. I wipe myself under the carpet with the rubbish. So that I must not look into the eye to myself and to others, that I dont have to painfully recognize how sad, miserable, and incompetent I really am. With aggression I hide my fragility, so you may not notice how lost, scared and alone I am. I would like to wash this floor clean and start all over again, but I one cannot turn back time, it will not flush away the deeds done.

The aim of the production of Helena Krinal and ZUGA dancers is to study the expressions, reactions, points of contact and influence of physical shame. Being a fully justified emotional reaction in every person’s life, shame, often unintentionally, is an extremely cunning mechanism for self-regulation, self-defense, and for limiting and controlling other people’s behavior. In collaboration with the dancers, the director creates a physical-sensory atmosphere, through which he also tries to influence the audience’s thoughts, feelings and sensitivity to shame.
