      "content": "ZUGA started to make a new dance piece for the children about wonder world, magic and game. In children's games most of the things will take place with the little help of magic.\n\n\"Now will we, adults try to find this magic power through dance, games and sounds. We try to catch the little audience so that they would help us during to find the game while we're playing. During the process we have tried to peek into the world of fairy tales and the characters there and what can be perceived by senses. The idea is to visit a far-away land without leaving the room.\"\n\nPerformance leaves space for spectator's fantasy, game happens through movement and dance and children have an opportunity to say what they think and change the direction of the game. Supported by the world of sounds created by the dancers.\n\nUnited dancers of ZUGA is a dance collective that was created 12 years ago by then young and active dance-makers Tiina Mölder, Kaja Kann and Jarmo Karing.
